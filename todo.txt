1.0 required features
===================

- cli needs to be a package manager for existing parts from a public library (i.e. bolts, motors go here), able to
-- query
-- download
-- update
(upload? -> probably git pull request for now)
- add external projects into one another (for example: make parts, show arrangement of a shelf in another project)

- slot with square ends -> rounded cube with one side = d + flat_edges does that. Should slot do that in reverse?

- de-centering a cube in one direction sucks, you have to add both center: false, center_x: true
	-> decenter ?

- bolt library needs to get a rewrite,
	- fetching dimensions from the imported Bolt library should be less awful

- needs a documentation and showcase

other awful things
===================

- command line interface isn't capable of adding parts to the output automatically

- user profile file should be auto generated with examples

- switching back and forth from and to openscad for preview sucks (that being said, switching from vim to something else would be awful to me)
