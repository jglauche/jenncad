1.0 required features
===================

- slot with square ends -> rounded cube with one side = d + flat_edges does that. Should slot do that in reverse?

- bolt library needs to get a rewrite,
	- fetching dimensions from the imported Bolt library should be less awful

- needs a documentation and showcase

Features wanted
===================
28.4.22:

- instead of moving Bolts output, make it the default to make their positions an anchor

- Bolt size data should be in a constant instead of one "Data" constant i.e.
	M2_5.head_dia
	M2_5.head_h
	M2_5_hole

- Bolt sizes should follow user configuration that can change margins
- Bolts should have an easier way to align than mirror them, maybe from :top
	 - but also, when you have a part that can be mounted in any top/bottom direction, 	you always end up having the bolts facing the wrong direction..
- Bolts should be able to also make thread inserts

8.5.22:
- need an easy way to switch between faces on an object to work efficiently in a 2.5D way
	i.e. I worked on a part stacking a few things, added a cube along and now wanted to use inner_anchors for the y face for screws. it was easier to make anchors manually for the prototype






other awful things
===================

- cli needs to use templates and user defined templates, profile loader needs to have this.

- user profile file should be auto generated with examples


Future plans
==================

- cli needs to be a package manager for existing parts from a public library (i.e. bolts, motors go here), able to
-- query
-- download
-- update
(upload? -> probably git pull request for now)
- add external projects into one another (for example: make parts, show arrangement of a shelf in another project)
