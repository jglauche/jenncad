1.0 required features
===================

- slot with square ends -> rounded cube with one side = d + flat_edges does that. Should slot do that in reverse?

- bolt library needs to get a rewrite,
	- fetching dimensions from the imported Bolt library should be less awful

- needs a documentation and showcase

Features wanted
===================
28.4.22:
- Parts often come with 4 holes around a center, and I often do something like:

[-1, 1].each do |i|
	[-1, 1].each do |j|
		res += @bolt.cut.move(x: @hole_center*i, y: @hole_center*j)
	end
end

there should be a shorter way to do this.


- instead of moving Bolts output, make it the default to make their positions an anchor

- Bolt size data should be in a constant instead of one "Data" constant i.e.
	M2_5.head_dia
	M2_5.head_h
	M2_5_hole

- Bolt sizes should follow user configuration that can change margins
- Bolts should have an easier way to align than mirror them, maybe from :top
	 - but also, when you have a part that can be mounted in any top/bottom direction, 	you always end up having the bolts facing the wrong direction..
- Bolts should be able to also make thread inserts




other awful things
===================

- cli needs to use templates and user defined templates, profile loader needs to have this.

- user profile file should be auto generated with examples


Future plans
==================

- cli needs to be a package manager for existing parts from a public library (i.e. bolts, motors go here), able to
-- query
-- download
-- update
(upload? -> probably git pull request for now)
- add external projects into one another (for example: make parts, show arrangement of a shelf in another project)
